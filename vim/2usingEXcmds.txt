Vim Basics

Using ex Commands

<:set nu> (Enter)   to turn line numbers on
<:set nonu> (Enter) to turn line numbers off

<:set ic> (Enter)   to ignore case during search
<:set noic> (Enter) to change back to the default, case-sensitive mode



Copying Lines

<:1,5 co 12> (Enter) to copy lines 1 through 5 and place the copied after line 12
<:.,5 co 12> (Enter) to copy the range from the current line through 5 and insert the block after line 12

<:6,$ co 2> (Enter) to copy the range from line 6 through the end of the file and insert the block after line 2


Period (.) to denote "from the current line"
Dollar sign ($) to denote "to end of file"

Moving/Deleting Lines

<:1,5 m 12> (Enter)
<:1,5 d> (Enter)


Searching and Replacing

A char string is one or more chars in succession

</ "char_string"> search the char string "char_string"
	<n> to go to the next occurrence
	<N> to go to the previous
<? "shar_string"> to search BACKWARD in a file


Certain special characters ( / & ! . ^ S \ ? ) have special significance to the search process and must be "escaped" (meaning \/ \& \! and so on. To escape a backslash itself, type <\\>) when they are used in a search:

</anything\?> to search for the string "anything?"


How to Make Searches More Precise (By Tagging)

. the beginning of the line (^)
	</^Search> to search the next line beginning with "Search"
. the end of the line ($)
	</search\.$> to search the next line ending with "search."
. the beginning of the word (\<); the end of the word (\>)
	"/\<beg" to search word starting with "beg"
	"/ing\>" to search word ending with "ing"
. any char (.)
	"/.tion"


Replacing a Char_String

":g/search-string/s//replace-string/g" (Enter)
":g/search-string/s//replace-string/gc" (Enter) ('c' consult)
"Ctrl+C" to cancel a "consulted" search-and-replace


Going to a Specific Line

"10G" to go to the line 10
"G" to go to the last line


Inserting a File into Another

"read" (insert) a file into the file you are editing

":84 r filename"
":r filename" - "read" file at the line on the cursor
