4. Writing and Executing a Script

. hello.sh
      |----------------------------------|
      | #!/bin/bash (or #!/usr/bin/zsh)  |
      | echo "Hello World"               |
      | exit 0                           |
      |----------------------------------|

. #!/bin/bash

	- this is always the first line of every script (aka, shebang)
	- the shebang start with a comment but the sys still uses this line
	- a comment in a shell script has the # symbol
	- the shebang instructs the sys to the interpreter to execute the script

. echo "Hello World" 

	- the command 'echo' is a shell builtin command and is used to print a STDOUT
	- the msg to print is enclosed in double-quotes

. exit 0

	- the exit cmd is a shell builtin and is used to exit the script
	- The exit code is supplied as an integer argument
	- A value anything other than 0 will indicate some error


Executing the Script

. will not be executed until you assign "execute permissions" for the script file

	$ chmod +x hello.sh
	$ ls -l
	$ ./hello.sh
	$ echo $?



. $0 : the name of the script
. $1 ~ $9 : the arguments of the script. $1 is the first argement, $2 the second and so on
. $@ : all the arguments
. $# : the number of arguments
. $? : the return code of the previous command
. $$ : PID (process id num) for the current script
. !! : the entire last command including argments
. $_ : the last argument from the last command
