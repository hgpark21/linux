2. Cmmd PATH

When you type a cmmd into the cmmd prmpt in Linux, it doesn't look in every directory but it only looks to the ONES you specified. They are a part of environment variable, called $PATH, which your shell checks in order to know where to look.

For example:

	$ echo $PATH
	# /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

How to Set Your PATH

	$ export PATH=$PATH:/place/with/the/file

You should be able to execute the script anywhere on your system without having to include the full path.

But this is TEMPORARY. If you restart your computer, your addition to $PATH is gone. This is by design. The variable $PATH is set by your shell every time it launches.

Set Your PATH PERMANENTLY

How to check which shell you run

	$ echo $0
	# -zsh

. $0 : the zeroth segment of a cmmd
. $1 : the first segment of a cmmd, e.g., in "$ echo $0", "echo" maps to $1

Add the line "export PATH=$PATH:/place/with/the/file to the appropriate file that will be read when your shell launches.
